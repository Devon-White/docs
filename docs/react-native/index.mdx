# React Native Library for SignalWire

## Installation

We suggest to use this library in the context of an Expo dev build, which you can initialize as follows:

```bash
npx create-react-native-app -t with-webrtnpx create-react-native-app -t with-webrtcc
```

This will set up a custom Expo development build from a template that is preconfigured for using WebRTC.

After that, you can install the React Native Library for SignalWire:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @signalwire-community/react-native react-native-get-random-values
```

## Hooks

You can use [most of the hooks](react/hooks.mdx) from _@signalwire-community/react into your React Native application.
